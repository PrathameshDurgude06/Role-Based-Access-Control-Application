# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI**

## **Project Overview**
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with an intuitive and responsive User Interface (UI) to manage users, roles, and permissions efficiently. The core objective is to provide administrators with the tools to manage users, assign roles, and set permissions while ensuring security, flexibility, and a user-friendly experience. This assignment aims to evaluate the creativity, understanding, and technical skills in building secure and functional UIs using modern web development tools.

## **Features Implemented**

### **User Management:**
- **View Users**: Display a list of all users with details like Name, Email, Role, and Status.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Users**: Provides the ability to add new users, edit existing ones, and delete users.
- **Role Assignment**: Admins can assign roles to users (Admin, Manager, User).
- **User Status Management**: Toggle the status of users between "Active" and "Inactive".

### **Role Management:**
- **Define/Edit Roles**: Admins can create and edit user roles.
- **Role Permissions**: Roles can include permissions such as "Read", "Write", and "Delete", allowing for fine-grained access control.

### **Permissions Handling:**
- **Assign/Modify Permissions**: Admins can easily manage permissions for roles through a dynamic permissions interface.

### **Search and Filter:**
- **User Search**: Search users by name or email.
- **Filter by Role/Status**: Filter users based on their role or status for efficient management.

### **Form Handling:**
- **Dynamic Forms**: Forms are used to add or edit users with fields for Name, Email, Role, and Status.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that all necessary fields are filled out before submission.

### **Interactive UI:**
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI with buttons for adding, editing, and deleting users, and toggling user status.
- **Notifications**: Success or error messages are displayed based on the actions performed (e.g., adding, editing, deleting users).

### **Loading State:**
- **Loading Spinner**: A loading spinner is shown when data is being fetched or a form is being submitted, providing a smooth user experience.

### **Responsive Design:**
The UI adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring seamless interaction on both desktop and mobile devices.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: React `useState`, `useEffect`
- **UI Styling**: CSS (custom styles)
- **API Simulation**: Mock API calls for user and role management CRUD operations
- **Form Validation**: Client-side form validation to ensure required fields are entered
- **Message Handling**: Dynamic success and error messages for feedback
- **Responsive Layout**: CSS media queries to ensure UI responsiveness

## **How to Use the Application**

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>

2. Install Dependencies:
Navigate to the project folder and run:

bash
Copy code
npm install

3. Start the Application:
To run the application locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
4. Access the Admin Dashboard:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/. You will be presented with a user management dashboard where you can add, edit, delete, and manage users and their roles. Use the search bar to find users by name or email and filter by role or status.

Key Components
User List Table:
Displays a list of users with options to edit, delete, and view their roles and status.
Includes search functionality to find users by name or email.
User Form:
A form used for adding and editing users, including fields for name, email, role, and status.
Validates input to ensure all required fields are filled.
Role and Permissions Management:
Admins can assign roles to users and define permissions associated with each role.
Permissions can be customized to allow actions such as read, write, and delete.
Features to Be Added (Optional Enhancements)
Role-Based Authentication:
Implement authentication based on user roles for more secure access to certain parts of the application.
Sorting and Pagination:
Add sorting functionality for user lists by name, email, or role.
Implement pagination for better user management in large datasets.
Backend Integration (Optional):
Integrate with a backend to persist user and role data, using RESTful APIs for user and role CRUD operations.
Evaluation Criteria
Creativity and Design Quality: The design follows modern UI principles and provides an intuitive, user-friendly experience. Creative solutions to handling user roles and permissions have been implemented.

Responsiveness: The application is fully responsive and works well across different screen sizes.

Functionality: All core RBAC features (user management, role management, permissions handling) are implemented and function as expected.

User Experience (UX): The UI is easy to navigate, and interactions are intuitive, ensuring ease of use for administrators.

Technical Skill: The code is clean, modular, and adheres to best practices in React development. Input validation and error handling are implemented effectively to ensure robustness.

Security Practices: Basic security measures, such as input validation and error handling, have been applied to prevent common issues like XSS or invalid data submission.

Documentation: The README file provides clear instructions for setup and usage, with a detailed overview of the project's structure and features.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to implementing a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using React.js. It allows admins to manage users, assign roles, and define permissions while ensuring security and ease of use. The UI is responsive, functional, and provides a smooth experience for administrators managing their user base and access control settings.
